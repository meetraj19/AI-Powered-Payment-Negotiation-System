### Basic Usage Examples

#### 1. Insurance Claims Processing

```python
from insurance_claim import InsuranceOperationsCrew
from models import InsuranceClaim, ClaimStatus
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize insurance crew
crew_system = InsuranceOperationsCrew(openai_api_key=api_key)

# Create insurance claim
claim = InsuranceClaim(
    claim_id="CLM_2024_001",
    policy_number="POL_123456",
    claim_amount=50000.00,
    incident_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=45),
    claim_type="accident",
    status=ClaimStatus.NEGOTIATING,
    days_pending=45
)

# Process claim with AI agents
result = crew_system.process_claim_settlement(claim, generate_pdf=True)
print(f"Settlement Status: {result['status']}")
```

#### 2. German Debt Collection

```python
from system import run_debt_collection_with_pdf_export

# Define debt collection case
case_data = {
    "case_id": "DEBT-2024-001",
    "debtor_name": "Company GmbH",
    "debt_amount": 25000.00,
    "debt_age_days": 60,
    "industry": "manufacturing",
    "location": "Stuttgart, Germany",
    "communication_language": "de"
}

# Run AI-powered debt collection analysis
result = run_debt_collection_with_pdf_export(case_data)
print(f"Recovery Probability: {result['parsed_data']['risk_assessment']['recovery_probability']:.1f}%")
```

#### 3. Payment Negotiation

```python
from neg_system import PaymentNegotiationCrew
from models import DebtNegotiation, DebtorProfile

# Initialize negotiation system
crew_system = PaymentNegotiationCrew(openai_api_key=api_key)

# Create negotiation scenario
negotiation = DebtNegotiation(
    negotiation_id="NEG_001",
    original_amount=50000.00
)

debtor_profile = DebtorProfile(
    credit_score=650,
    monthly_income=5000.00,
    monthly_obligations=3500.00
)

# Execute multi-agent negotiation
result = crew_system.run_complex_negotiation(
    negotiation, 
    debtor_profile, 
    generate_pdf=True
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OpenAI API Errors
```bash
# Rate limit exceeded
Error: openai.RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota

Solution:
1. Check your OpenAI billing and add credits
2. Implement exponential backoff in your code
3. Consider using gpt-3.5-turbo for cost optimization
```

#### PDF Generation Issues
```bash
# ReportLab style conflicts
Error: "Style 'BodyText' already defined in stylesheet"

Solution:
1. Update to the latest code version
2. Clear Python cache: python -m py_compile src/
3. Restart Python environment
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Out of memory errors
Error: OutOfMemoryError during large document processing

Solution:
1. Increase available RAM
2. Use model with fewer parameters
3. Process documents in smaller batches
```

### Debug Mode

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Test individual components
python -c "from system import test_pdf_generation_only; test_pdf_generation_only()"
```
